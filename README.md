# Noyon's AI Narrative Research Portfolio

Hello! I am a second-year student and a self-directed researcher specializing in the creative and analytical applications of Large Language Models.

This portfolio is a curated collection of my case studies where I test, analyze, and document the capabilities of generative AI for complex storytelling. My work involves stress-testing various LLMs (starting with DeepSeek) on a wide range of creative challenges to understand their strengths, limitations, and potential for human-AI partnership.

## üèÜ Featured Projects (Case Studies)

*These are my lead projects. Each repository is a complete package containing the in-depth case study, the original raw AI chat log, and the final polished story elements for full transparency.*

### 1. Case Study: AI-Assisted Exploration of Psychological Depth & Taboo Themes
* **Description:** A deep dive into an AI's ability to generate a nuanced psychological drama centered on sensitive themes, testing its capacity for handling subtext, trauma, and complex character motivations.
* **AI Model Used:** DeepSeek
* **[‚û°Ô∏è View Project Repository](https://github.com/Noyonbond47/AI-Emotional-Depth-Analysis)** *(Contains: Full Case Study, Raw Chat Log, Polished Story Elements)*

### 2. Case Study: Dual-Narrative Synthesis and Tonal Control
* **Description:** An analysis of an AI's ability to maintain two tonally opposite storylines‚Äîa wholesome slice-of-life romance and a gritty delinquent drama‚Äîwithin a single, cohesive narrative.
* **AI Model Used:** DeepSeek
* **[‚û°Ô∏è View Project Repository](https://github.com/Noyonbond47/AI-Handling-of-Dual-Narrative)** *(Contains: Full Case Study, Raw Chat Log, World-Building PDF, Final Story)*

### 3. Case Study: Multi-Genre Narrative Synthesis
* **Description:** An ambitious initial project to test an AI's performance on a complex, multi-threaded narrative that combines five distinct genres of Japanese media into a single, coherent plotline.
* **AI Model Used:** DeepSeek
* **[‚û°Ô∏è View Project Repository](https://github.com/Noyonbond47/Genre-mashing-using-AI)** *(Contains: Full Case Study, Raw Chat Log, Final Story Summary)*

### Future Research Areas

My research pipeline is actively expanding to explore new facets of AI-driven storytelling. Future case studies will focus on:

* **Fanfiction & Established IPs:** Analyzing an AI's ability to adhere to existing lore, maintain character voice consistency, and meet the high expectations of established fan communities.
* **Real-Life Events:** Testing an AI's capacity to generate compelling narratives based on historical or current events while navigating the ethical considerations of representing reality.
* **Advanced Interpersonal Dynamics:** Continuing the exploration of complex themes like power, manipulation, and trust in character relationships.

*(Disclaimer: The projects above were executed using DeepSeek AI with the help of its DeepThink functionality. For research purposes, character names and locations are for reference only.)*
